PROJECT: RuneSquare - Skill Training Game
GAME CONCEPT:
I'm building "RuneSquare" - a simple skill-based training game in pygame. The player controls a character on a small island with various training stations where they can level up different skills (like Woodcutting, Mining, Fishing, etc.). This is my first game, inspired by RuneScape's skill system but much simpler.
CORE FEATURES:

Single scene with an island environment
Player character that walks around
Multiple skill training stations (trees, rocks, fishing spots, etc.)
Skill progression system with XP and levels
Simple inventory system
UI showing current skills, XP, and inventory
Click-to-move or WASD movement
Interaction system (click on objects to train skills)

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Use modular design with clear separation of concerns
Implement proper game loop structure
Follow pygame best practices
Use classes and OOP principles appropriately
Keep components decoupled and reusable
Include proper error handling and comments
Structure code for easy testing and debugging
Design systems to be easily extensible (adding new skills should be simple)

CODE STANDARDS:

Use descriptive variable and function names
Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
Add docstrings for classes and complex functions
Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
Use type hints where appropriate
Organize imports properly

SKILL SYSTEM DESIGN:

Each skill has: name, current_xp, level, xp_to_next_level
Training activities give XP based on player level and activity
Higher levels unlock better training methods or rewards
Simple formula: level = floor(sqrt(xp / 100)) or similar

INTERACTION SYSTEM:

Click on objects to start training
Show progress bar during training actions
Automatic inventory management for gathered items
Prevent movement while training (or allow cancellation)

WHEN HELPING ME:

Always suggest modular solutions that can be easily extended
Focus on making it easy to add new skills and training stations
Explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions
Point out potential coupling issues and suggest improvements
Help me maintain clean separation between game logic, UI, and rendering
Suggest appropriate design patterns for skill/progression systems
Keep solutions simple but extensible for a beginner
Consider save/load functionality from the start

IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:

Basic player movement and island rendering
Simple interaction system (click to interact)
One working skill (like Woodcutting) with XP gain
Basic UI to show skill progress
Then expand to multiple skills


RuneSquare Development Phases
Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1)
Goal: Basic island with player movement and one working skill
Day 1-2: Project Setup & Basic Movement

 Create project directory structure
 Set up pygame window with island background
 Implement Player class with WASD or click-to-move
 Create basic camera/viewport system
 Add collision detection for island boundaries

Day 3-4: Interaction System

 Implement click detection on game objects
 Create base SkillStation class
 Add one training station (Tree for Woodcutting)
 Build basic interaction UI (progress bar, training feedback)

Day 5-7: First Skill System

 Create SkillManager class for XP and leveling
 Implement Woodcutting skill with XP gain
 Add simple inventory system for logs
 Create basic UI panel showing Woodcutting level/XP

Phase 2: Skill Expansion (Week 2)
Goal: Multiple skills and refined systems
Day 8-10: Additional Skills

 Add Mining skill with Rock stations
 Implement Fishing skill with fishing spots
 Create different training speeds/XP rates per skill
 Add variety in training objects (different tree types, etc.)

Day 11-14: UI and Polish

 Build comprehensive skill panel showing all skills
 Improve inventory UI with item icons and counts
 Add sound effects for training actions
 Implement level-up notifications and celebrations

Phase 3: Polish & Features (Week 3)
Goal: Complete game with save system and polish
Day 15-17: Advanced Features

 Add save/load functionality for player progress
 Implement skill requirements (need level X to access Y)
 Create simple achievement system
 Add more visual feedback and animations

Day 18-21: Final Polish

 Balance XP rates and skill progression
 Add background music and ambient sounds
 Create simple settings menu
 Final testing and bug fixes

Key Game Systems
1. Skill Progression
pythonclass Skill:
    def __init__(self, name, current_xp=0):
        self.name = name
        self.current_xp = current_xp
    
    @property
    def level(self):
        return int(math.sqrt(self.current_xp / 100))
    
    def add_xp(self, amount):
        old_level = self.level
        self.current_xp += amount
        return self.level > old_level  # Return True if leveled up
2. Training Stations
pythonclass SkillStation:
    def __init__(self, x, y, skill_type, base_xp, base_time):
        self.position = (x, y)
        self.skill_type = skill_type
        self.base_xp = base_xp
        self.base_time = base_time
        self.is_occupied = False
    
    def start_training(self, player):
        # Begin training action
        pass
3. Island Layout Ideas

Center: Player spawn point, maybe a small hut
North: Forest area with different tree types
East: Rocky area with mining spots
South: Beach with fishing spots
West: Maybe farming area or crafting stations

Skill Ideas for RuneSquare
Core Skills (Start with these)

Woodcutting: Click trees, gain logs, XP based on tree type
Mining: Click rocks, gain ores, different rock types
Fishing: Click fishing spots, gain fish, maybe different spots

Future Skills (Phase 2+)

Cooking: Use fish/other items, combine with fires
Crafting: Combine materials to make items
Combat: Maybe simple monster fighting
Farming: Plant seeds, wait for growth, harvest

Technical Considerations

Save System: JSON file with player skills, inventory, position
Performance: Use sprite groups, efficient collision detection
Extensibility: Easy to add new skills via configuration
UI Scaling: Design UI to work on different screen sizes

Art Style (Keep Simple)

Top-down 2D view (easiest for first game)
Pixel art or simple shapes (rectangles, circles)
Clear visual distinction between different objects
Simple animations (maybe idle animations for stations)
